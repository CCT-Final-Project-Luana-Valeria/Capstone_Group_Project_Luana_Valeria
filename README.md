## **Predictive Policing in the Dublin Metropolitan Region**
### `Abstract`
One of the challenges for police and government agencies is accurately forecasting potential criminal activity based on historical crime data. The utilization of efficient algorithms to predict occurrences has become increasingly important nowadays, with crime analysis achieving widespread prominence through machine learning and data mining practices. While these tools can significantly enhance effective prevention strategies, it remains critical to uphold privacy rights and civil liberties when implementing them. This report will focus on An Garda Síochána - the Irish police force - specifically concentrating on the Dublin Metropolitan Region given its elevated incidence rate. We will employ a supervised learning technique by comparing various algorithms. This will enable us to identify the most efficacious model best suited to predicting crime incidences from the available Kaggle dataset. The subjects of predictive policing, civil rights violations and privacy concerns will be addressed in this report. Additionally, the six stages within CRISP-DM will also be discussed.
